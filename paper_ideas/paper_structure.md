# Paper Outline: Metabolic Remodeling in Neuroinflammation

## Introduction
- Multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology can be viewed through both **outside-in** (immune infiltration drives CNS injury) and **inside-out** (primary glial/mitochondrial dysfunction initiates pathology) frameworks.  
- Metabolic remodeling (glycolytic shifts, lactate shuttling, mitochondrial suppression) has been implicated in both scenarios but remains poorly resolved across **cell types**, **disease courses**, and **spatial lesion contexts**.  
- Here, we use spatial transcriptomics across EAE models and a complementary oligodendrocyte-specific mitochondrial injury model to map **bioenergetic remodeling in neuroinflammation**.

## Results Structure

### 1. Tissue-Level Remodeling
- Global metabolic module scores (glycolysis, OXPHOS, lactate shuttle) across entire spinal cord sections.  
- Compare across disease courses (onset, peak, remission, chronic).  
- **Key point:** Neuroinflammation induces broad Warburg-like metabolic shifts, partially reversible in remission.

### 2. Cell Type–Specific Remodeling Across Courses
- **Astrocytes**: strongest and most consistent glycolytic/lactate rewiring.  
- **Microglia**: major glycolytic and redox activation, immune-metabolic cross-talk.  
- **Oligodendrocytes**: relatively stable, limited plasticity.  
- **NFOLs / OPCs**: partial metabolic rewiring, relevant to remyelination failure.  
- **Fibroblasts**: subtle metabolic shifts, tissue environment adaptation.  
- **Key point:** Astrocytes and microglia act as metabolic “hotspots,” while oligodendrocyte lineage cells show only partial susceptibility.

### 3. Lesion-Proximity Analysis
- Define concentric zones (core → rim → perilesional → distal).  
- Astrocytes and microglia: strongest lesion-proximal glycolytic rewiring.  
- Oligodendrocyte lineage: modest proximity effect.  
- Fibroblast and endothelial responses as supportive tissue remodeling.  
- **Key point:** Lesion rims represent the epicenter of metabolic reprogramming.

### 4. Immune Cells in the Metabolic Niche
- T cells, B cells, macrophages embedded within glycolytic, lactate-rich glial niches.  
- APC/DC oxidative stress signatures.  
- **Key point:** Immune infiltration coincides with — and may be supported by — local glial metabolic rewiring.

### 5. Inside-Out Model (Oligodendrocyte mtDNA Damage)
- Use mouse model with Cre-driven double-stranded breaks in oligodendrocyte mtDNA.  
- Show astrocyte and microglia metabolic activation resembling lesion signatures.  
- Compare directly with EAE-derived metabolic fingerprints.  
- **Key point:** Primary oligodendrocyte mitochondrial injury is sufficient to trigger lesion-like glial metabolic remodeling, supporting an “inside-out” component in MS.

## Discussion
- Integration of **outside-in** (immune infiltration) and **inside-out** (intrinsic glial mitochondrial dysfunction) models of MS.  
- Astrocytes and microglia emerge as central hubs of metabolic rewiring in both contexts.  
- Clinical implication: metabolic interventions (e.g., lactate modulation, antioxidants, mitochondrial support) may have **cell type–specific efficacy**.  
- Broader perspective: connect CNS metabolic stress to systemic metabolism (exercise, diet, mitochondrial therapies).

## Next Steps
- Refine gene/module lists for each pathway (glycolysis, OXPHOS, lactate shuttle, antioxidant stress).  
- Build preliminary figures aligned to this outline.  
- Start drafting results text section-by-section, guided by the figure plan.
